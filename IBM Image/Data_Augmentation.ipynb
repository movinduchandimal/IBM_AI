The purpose of this lab is to show that the Augmented data improves generalization performance.\n","\n","Think of a scenario where a drone has to take a picture of an object. The drone is moving and the object can also possibly be moving. When an image is taken we arent always going to get perfect images. The subject may not be perfectly centered in the image or the subject may be rotated in the image. In this case, a model trained on perfectly centered or rotated images won't perform well. This is why we train a model on rotated data so it can perform well on imperfect images.\n","\n","In this assignment, we will use a dataset of digit images. We will have two models one trained on non rotated digits and one trained on rotated images and then we will test the models on a rotated testing dataset which will be more realistic and robust in
